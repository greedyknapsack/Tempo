## **Data Masking Overview**

### **What is Data Masking?**

Data Masking is the process of **hiding sensitive information** by replacing it with **obfuscated, scrambled, or fake** data that retains **realistic format and structure**. It is used in **non-production environments** (like dev, test, UAT) to protect **PII, PCI, PHI**, and other confidential data.

---

## **Objectives**

* Protect **sensitive data** in non-prod environments
* Comply with **data privacy regulations** (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
* Maintain **realism** in test data for accurate testing
* Enable **safe sharing** of data across teams or vendors

---

## **Types of Data Masking**

| Type                                | Description                                | Example                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Substitution**                    | Replace with realistic fake values         | “John” → “Peter”                         |
| **Shuffling**                       | Randomize values within the column         | Email addresses reordered                |
| **Redaction**                       | Hide data partially/completely             | “9876-XXXX-XXXX”                         |
| **Nulling Out**                     | Replace with `NULL` or blank               | “ssn” → `NULL`                           |
| **Encryption**                      | Encode data securely (reversible)          | “1234” → Encrypted blob                  |
| **Tokenization**                    | Replace with tokens (usually irreversible) | “Acct123” → “TKN456”                     |
| **Format-Preserving Masking (FPM)** | Replace data keeping length, structure     | “123-45-6789” → “345-98-6543”            |
| **Data Variance**                   | Maintain statistical properties            | Salary mean stays same but values differ |

Here is a **comprehensive overview of Data Discovery**, especially as part of **Test Data Management (TDM)** and **compliance workflows**:

---

## **Data Discovery Overview**

### **What is Data Discovery?**

Data Discovery is the process of locating, identifying, and classifying data across various sources to understand what data exists, where it resides, and what it contains—especially with a focus on **sensitive or regulated data**.

It’s typically the **first step** in a TDM or data governance lifecycle.

---

## **Objectives**

* Identify **sensitive data** (PII, PCI, PHI)
* Understand **data inventory** across systems
* Enable **masking rules**, **access controls**
* Support **compliance** (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
* Prepare datasets for **profiling**, **subsetting**, and **masking**

---

## **Key Elements of Data Discovery**

| Element                      | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source Discovery**         | Scans databases, file systems, APIs, etc., to identify available data sources |
| **Schema Discovery**         | Extracts tables, columns, data types, constraints                             |
| **Sensitive Data Detection** | Uses patterns, rules, keywords to find sensitive fields                       |
| **Metadata Collection**      | Captures names, types, relationships, sizes                                   |
| **Tagging & Classification** | Labels columns/tables with sensitivity level (e.g., confidential, public)     |
| **Policy Mapping**           | Links discovered fields to policies (e.g., GDPR Article 9)                    |

---

## **Formal Steps in Data Discovery**

| Step | Name                  | Description                                         |

Here is a **comprehensive overview of Data Profiling**, especially in the context of **Test Data Management (TDM)** and **compliance**:

---

## **Data Profiling Overview**

### **What is Data Profiling?**

Data Profiling is the process of analyzing source data to understand its structure, content, quality, and relationships. It helps ensure data is **fit for purpose**, especially before masking, subsetting, or test data generation.

---

## **Objectives of Data Profiling**

* Identify **sensitive data** (PII/PCI)
* Detect **anomalies**, **inconsistencies**, **nulls**
* Discover **relationships** and **metadata**
* Support **TDM**, **masking rules**, **compliance checks**

---

## **Key Profiling Types**

| Type                        | Description                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Structure Profiling**     | Analyzes metadata (data types, formats, lengths) |
| **Content Profiling**       | Checks actual values, nulls, blanks, patterns    |
| **Relationship Profiling**  | Identifies foreign keys, primary keys, joins     |
| **Pattern Profiling**       | Finds regex-like patterns (e.g., emails, SSNs)   |

  * "Any column with value like ‘@’ may be an email"

Rules are applied within Policies to:

* Detect sensitive fields
* Decide masking or encryption strategy
* Classify and label data

---

## **Scenarios/Challenges Solved**

* **Detecting Hidden PII**: Profiling uncovers unexpected sensitive data.
* **Pre-Masking Prep**: Ensures correct columns are masked with right type.
* **Data Quality Issues**: Identifies nulls, wrong types, invalid formats.
* **Duplicate Handling**: Finds repeated records before testing.
* **Schema Validation**: Verifies DB structure vs expected design.
* **Rule Violations**: Detects rule breaks like negative ages, future dates.

---

## **Use Cases**

* Pre-masking data assessment
* Sensitive data classification
* TDM rule application
* Data quality reporting
* Regulatory audits
* Schema and format validation

---

## **Tools**
